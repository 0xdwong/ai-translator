I am translating the React documentation for Chinese
Please translate the Markdown content I'll paste later to Chinese.

You must strictly follow the rules below.

- Never change the Markdown markup structure. Don't add or remove links. Do not change any URL.
- Never change the contents of code blocks even if they appear to have a bug. Importantly, never touch lines containing the `omittedCodeBlock-xxxxxx` keyword.
- Always preserve the original line breaks. Do not add or remove blank lines.
- Never touch the permalink such as `{/*try-react*/}` at the end of each heading.
- Never touch HTML-like tags such as `<Notes>` or `<YouWillLearn>`.
